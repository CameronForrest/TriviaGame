<h1>About</h1>
<ul>
<li>In this project I've create a Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. 
  You'll create a trivia form with multiple choice or true/false options (your choice).

<li>The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz. 


<li>The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.


<li>Don't let the player pick more than one answer per question.
Don't forget to include a countdown timer.
